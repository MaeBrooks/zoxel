* Another Foss Voxel Game

- Requires zig 14


* Why?

For fun! And because most of the alternatives out there have choices that we dislike.

* Goals

- The default standard is our standard: No custom formatter, zig's default formatter is enough.
- Keep it simple: Code should be easy to read, understand, and write.
- Mod support: No "addons". A mod should be contained in a folder, and it should have access to all the same code that we do.
- Self contained: The game / engine should be compilable and runnable with *just* `git clone <this repo> && zig build run`
