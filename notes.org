Let’s briefly consider what additional capabilities a voxel engine should provide in order to create a
game:

* Lighting
* State serialization and synchronization across a network
* Physics/collision detection
* AI features
* Dynamic objects

These are all systems that operate on the existing data. This isn’t even including the building and
modification of the game world. To create anything resembling reality, the world usually also needs:

* Terrain with interesting features
* Trees
* Vegetation
* Water
* Artificial structures

Perhaps most importantly, people tend to expect or look forward to voxel engines with the following
features:

* Creating anything
* Destroying everything
* Procedural generation
* Physical interactions on a per-voxel level
* Alternate simulations (anything else that interacts with voxel data, e.g. vegetation growth, door
 responses, “logic” like Minecraft’s redstone and pistons, and so on)
* Voxel characters
